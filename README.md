### Repo Description
Port of the [DuraDisplay](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/DuraDisplay) mod from GTNH for modern versions, made in Kotlin. <br>
With Compatibility for Gregtech and AE2 and maybe more to come!

### CF Description
This mod is a modern port of [DuraDisplay](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/DuraDisplay), allowing you to display your durability and some measurements in other units instead of only having a boring durability bar.

Currently the mod adds compatibility for durability and energy, with fluid to come soon.

Mods like [GTCEuM](https://github.com/GregTechCEu/GregTech-Modern) and [AE2](https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/) are fully supported, and will display values in their respective units, ie: AE for AE2 and EU for GTCEuM. Any other mods adding electric items, like [Mekanism](https://github.com/mekanism/mekanism) are fully supported out of the box!

Currently supported modes are:
- Default: Will display the default durability/energy bar
- Percentage: Will display a percentage based on current amount and max amount <br>

- Number: Will show a formatted number from the current amount, ie: 2,134,000 -> 2.13M etc.. <br>
