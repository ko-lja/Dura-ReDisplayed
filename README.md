### Repo Description
Port of the [DuraDisplay](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/DuraDisplay) mod from GTNH for modern versions, made in Kotlin. <br>
With Compatibility for Gregtech and AE2 and maybe more to come!

### CF Description
This mod is a modern port of DuraDisplay, allowing you to display your durability and some measurements in other units instead of only having a boring durability bar.

Currently the mod adds compatibility for durability and energy, with fluid to come soon.

Mods like GTCEuM and AE2 are fully supported, and will display values in their respective units, ie: AE for AE2 and EU for GTCEuM. Any other mods adding electric items, like Mekanism are fully supported out of the box!

Currently supported modes are:
- Default: Will display the default durability/energy bar
- Percentage: Will display a percentage based on current amount and max amount
- Number: Will show a formatted number from the current amount, ie: 2,134,000 -> 2.13M etc..
- Scientific: Will show a number formatted into scientific notation, ie: 2,134,000 -> 2.1e6

Credits:
- Caedis for creating the original mod for 1.7.10
- GTNewHorizons for maintaining that version and having a permissive license allowing me to port this!
